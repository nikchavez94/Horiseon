#Challenge 01: Code Refactor
This challenge was meant to have students of the coding bootcamp look closely at a functional code for a website. Although the code worked perfectly, the code was not written according to best practice and coding standards. The challenge was for students to edit the code to reflect best coding practices in changing element types, and restructuring the css code to reflect the best possible organization.

## Introduction
In taking a look at the code is VS Code, you can following along with the comments to see which changes were made. These changes were made to reflect best coding practices. This challenge pushed the coding students to reflect on a functional code but change it  to meet a better organizational criteria. This project can help other students understand why certain structural and elemental changes are necessary in coding. To get the best out of this project make sure to read the comments throughout the code in green. 

## Changes Made 
Many of the changes that took place were changing the very unspecific "div" tag to a more specific tag such as "section" or "aside." After the HTML changes were made, the CSS was then optimized to connect to the HTML. The order that the CSS was put in was also modified and in some ways condensed. 

## Contributions
The bootcamp classes acted as contributions to this project. Without the courses I would have been completely lost. W3 Schools was also used as a reference to differentiate between different tags.
